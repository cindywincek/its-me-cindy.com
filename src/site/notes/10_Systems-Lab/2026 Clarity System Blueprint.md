**Status:** Sapling
**Last updated:** 2025-12-06

**How to Use This Page** 
Use this page as the map behind everything else in my garden: if a system, project, or experiment shows up elsewhere, it should trace back to a principle or constraint listed here. When you or I are confused about why I’m doing something, come back to this page to see the ‘why’ and adjust it if the map no longer matches reality.

## **The Foundational Principle**

**Meaning is the Prerequisite for Structure.** I must understand the purpose (the _why_) of a task, tool, or system before I can engage with the steps (the _how_). Lack of meaning leads to paralysis and cognitive shutdown.

**ADHD focus:** If it doesn’t support clarity, it doesn’t get my energy.

## **Themes (choose 3)**

- Visibility (personal website) | Depth (research) | Flow (creative)
- **Bold rule:** **WIP ≤ 2 active creative projects**

## **Constraints**

- Time blocks I’ll protect: …
- Tech stack: **No new tools unless replacing one.**
- Budget / collaboration boundaries: …

## **Anti-goals (what I will NOT do)**

- **No adding platforms without removing one**
- **No more than 2 parallel “big” goals**
- **No endless reorganizing — decide, then try for 2 weeks**

## **Measures (1–2 per theme)**

- Visibility: email signups or inquiry starts
- Depth: 1 monthly synthesis memo
- Flow: 2 zero-draft sessions/week

## **Quarterly outcomes (Q1)**

### **Q1**

- **Tech stack decided**: audit completed, replacements chosen, and **cancel 2+ redundant apps**.
- **Curiosity Capture automation live**: Zapier nightly flow running for **14 days**, then review clarity score and keep/adjust.
- **Data migration v1**: **Migrate top 20 high‑value items** into Obsidian with simple tags; enable voice-to-text capture as default.

## **Cadences**

- Weekly: **Rule of 3 outcomes**, **90‑min Clarity Sprint**, publish/share 1 thing  
      
    Monthly: **Review + pruning (stop-doing list)**

## **Decision log**

- Bold cue: **If reversible → decide within 24 hours**

## **Risks + mitigations**

- Risk: tool sprawl → Mitigation: **Obsidian-first capture + monthly cancel check**

## **Clarity score (0–10 weekly)**

- If <7: what’s fuzzy? one action to raise it this week

## **Prefills for your areas**

- Personal Website: **3 standout pages**, 2 posts/month, track 1 metric
	- **Obsidian Publishing Setup (Systems Lab Note)**

		- **Tool:** Obsidian Publish
		- **Aesthetic Goal:** Emulate the "stacked" interface and card view layout you liked from your research (referencing [[Summary of Public Learning Resources I have reviewed\|Summary of Public Learning Resources I have reviewed]]
		- **Structure:** Use a dedicated `Publish` folder in the Obsidian vault.
		- **Workflow:** Draft in Mem → Export to Obsidian `Drafts`  folder → Move to `Publish; folder for public site sync`.
		- **Initial Content:** [[00-Start-Here/Welcome\|Welcome]], [[40_About/About Me\|About Me]],[[10_Systems-Lab/Cindy’s North Star — My Clarity Compass\|Cindy’s North Star — My Clarity Compass]], [[20_Learning-Log/🧠 Metacognition - My Semantic Brain & Clarity\|🧠 Metacognition - My Semantic Brain & Clarity]], [[10_Systems-Lab/Cindy’s Cognitive Signatures + Systems Thinking (Working Note)\|Cindy’s Cognitive Signatures + Systems Thinking (Working Note)]]and this [[10_Systems-Lab/2026 Clarity System Blueprint\|2026 Clarity System Blueprint]]note.

- Research: **2–3 guiding questions**, 10 must-reads/quarter, 1 memo/month  

- Creative: **Zero-draft 2×/week**, share 1 snippet/week
