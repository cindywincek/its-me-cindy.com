## Why This Exists

This note is my anchor and compass. When I feel scattered, overwhelmed, or pulled in a million directions, I return here to remind myself of what truly matters.

## My Why

I want clarity around my goals, values, and the kind of life I’m creating. I seek presence, intention, and a life with less chaos—this is my North Star.

## Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity over complexity:** I choose systems and routines that are simple, repeatable, and low-friction.
- **Universal capture:** Everything (notes, ideas, voice memos, bookmarks, screenshots) starts in one place—Mem—before going anywhere else.
- **Context matters:** I aim to add a “why” or short motivation to every capture, so I remember why it matters.
- **Review and adjust:** I check in regularly (at least weekly) to clarify, organize, and let go of what’s not aligned.
- **Intention first:** I move with intention, not just urgency. If something doesn’t support clarity, it doesn’t need my energy.

## Check-in Prompt

> “Does this support my goal of clarity and an intentional life?”

> “Am I acting in alignment with my North Star?”

## TL;DR About Me

I’m getting an intentional head start on 2026. I want clarity around my goals, my values, and the kind of life I’m building. I’m starting with very small, sustainable micro-habits — my first goal is one habit I can stick with for seven straight days. I want more presence, more intention, and less chaos.

My ADHD makes inconsistent systems fall apart, so I need tools and workflows that are simple, repeatable, and low-friction. I’m trying to streamline my tech stack and cut down the noise. I’m shifting toward tools that feel trustworthy and aligned instead of juggling dozens of apps.

I also want calmer daily rhythms: better rituals, better inputs, fewer digital and mental clutter points. I’m building a digital garden and a “learning in public” practice and I want Mem to be my universal capture tool and inbox — the place where everything goes first so I can actually reuse it.

My goal is to enter 2026 with ease, clarity, and intention, not scrambling to figure things out once the year starts.

## Extra Context To Help You Work With Me

- I’m simplifying my tech stack right now because I bounce between my laptop, iPhone, and iPad and end up duplicating searches, notes, and saves.
- I want to replace as many capture-type tools as possible: notes, voice memos, screenshots, saved links, highlights, random thoughts, bookmarks, etc.
- I’m experimenting with using Mem as my universal inbox — everything lands here before I move it somewhere else (if it even needs to move).
- I want voice-to-text to be a core part of my workflow because that’s the fastest and most natural way for me to capture things with ADHD.
- I’m in exploration mode with Mem (again) right now, but my long-term goal is simplicity, not more complexity. I want fewer tools, fewer decisions, and one central place to offload my brain.
