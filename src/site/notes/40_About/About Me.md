## My North Star: Clarity

I’m entering 2026 with one intention: **clarity**. Clarity in what I value, how I make decisions, what I’m building, and how I want to move through my life. I’ve lived long enough to know what happens when I don’t have it—chaos creeps in, overwhelm takes over, and I disconnect from myself. I’m not available for that anymore.

This website is the framework that keeps me grounded, honest, and connected to who I’m becoming.

## How I Think (My Cognitive Signature)

I am a **semantic-first thinker**. I perceive _meaning, pattern, essence, trajectory, and vibe_ before I see steps or details.

This is why I publish: **Externalizing my thinking** is the most effective way to process and refine my semantic patterns. This space is my digital garden, where I turn raw thoughts into structured insights.

## My Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity over complexity:** I choose systems and routines that are simple, repeatable, and low-friction.
- **Intention First:** If something doesn’t support clarity, it doesn’t get my energy.
- **Learning in Public:** I focus on knowing the facts, noticing my reactions, and turning both into something written that I can return to.
